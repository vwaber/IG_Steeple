The purpose of this project was simply to model a particular church steeple using OpenGL. In order to aide with this task I spent most of my effort creating custom functions to draw n-sided prisms and pyramids. Normals for each face are also computed to allow for correct lighting effects. All objects in this project are constructed using these functions.

This project was originally built using Visual C++ and GLUT, but has since been minimally altered to use MinGW and freeglut.
