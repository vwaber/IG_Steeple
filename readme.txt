The purpose of this project was simply to model a particular church steeple using OpenGL.
Being a simple exercise in 3D modeling there were no requirements in lighting or realism.
In order to aide with this task I spent most of my effort creating custom functions to draw n-sided prisms and pyramids.
Normals for each face are also computed to allow for correct lighting effects.
